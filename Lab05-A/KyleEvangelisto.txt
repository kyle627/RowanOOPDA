1. B::f1()
2. A::f1() is overloaded, f1(int n1) has the same name in class A.
3. B::f1(int n1) is the override. B is the subclass and B::f1(int n1) 
overrides in the super class.
4. Yes Statement 2 is legal. It calls the subclass which has access to the superclass
and therefore access to A::f2(int n1)
5. No, the field var2 is not visible in the call int num3 = b.var2; And there is no
getter method displayed in the document.
6. Yes, it is legal, A can be a new B because A is the super class 
or parent of B.
7. Superclass is A. Subclass is B.
7b. Derived class is B. Child class is B.
8. Private methods are inherrited from the super class but they 
can't be changed or altered at all. However all or some of those methods 
can change the instance variables
